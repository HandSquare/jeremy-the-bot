# Jeremy

Jeremy is a chatbot for Slack in continuous development. He's just a regular guy!

Run `npm start` after cloning to start Jeremy locally.   
He is also running online at jeremy-the-bot.herokuapp.com so you can pause him there.

There's a `config.json` of client secrets that you'll need to put in the root directory. Ask Nick for it.

## Other projects
Jeremy cameos in [spwank, the text adventure game.](https://github.com/HandSquare/spwank).
To interact with Jeremy, you will also need the `config.json` mentioned above. Ask Nick!
