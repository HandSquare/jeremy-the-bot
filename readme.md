# Jeremy

Jeremy is a chatbot for Slack in continuous development. He's just a regular guy!

Run `npm start` after cloning to start Jeremy locally.  
He is also running online at jeremy-the-bot.herokuapp.com so you can pause him there.

There's a `.env` of client secrets that you'll need to put in the root directory. It's on the github marked as private.
To interact with Jeremy, you will also need the `config.json` mentioned above. Ask Nick!
