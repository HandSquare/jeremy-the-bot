# Jeremy

Jeremy is a chat-bot for Slack in continuous development. He's just a regular guy!

Run `npm start` after cloning to start Jeremy locally.   
He is also running online at jeremy-the-bot.herokuapp.com so you can pause him there.

There's a `config.json` of client secrets that you'll need to put in the root directory. Ask Nick for it.
